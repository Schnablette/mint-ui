# MintUI - UI Components for the Web3 Startup

## Our Vision

We believe a great user experience begins with a great builder experience. Because of this, we strive to provide designers and developers with top-notch tools to aid in actualizing quality ideas.

## The Problem

Developers want to deliver usable, accessible Web3 experiences but aren't given the resources they need to fully succeed. Startups in the space innovate and have ideas worth sharing, but the monetary strain most of them face leads to a poor Dapp experience for the end user.

## The Solution

Enter MintUI, a component library of usable, accesible components for developers and startups to leverage. The ease of use and customizability of these building blocks make creating browser-based software faster, cheaper, and more attainable.
